# Summary Patterns (Reference, Not Templates)

Use this file as a pattern library. Copying a fixed structure is not required.

## 1) Minimal thinking path
Before drafting, answer:
1. What is the core problem?
2. What is the strongest conclusion?
3. What evidence/path makes it trustworthy?
4. What caveats or boundaries should readers know?

## 2) Practical writing patterns

### Pattern A: Technical deep dive
- Opening: what this article explains.
- Core mechanism: key data/control flow or design choices.
- Trade-offs: performance, complexity, maintainability.
- Actionable takeaways: when to use/avoid.

### Pattern B: Incident or debugging postmortem
- Symptom and impact.
- Root cause and triggering conditions.
- Fix and why it works.
- Regression guard and lessons learned.

### Pattern C: Comparison article
- Compared options and scope.
- Key dimensions and differences.
- Decision guidance by scenario.

### Pattern D: Non-technical essay/learning note
- Central question or viewpoint.
- Main reasoning thread.
- Practical implications for readers.

## 3) Styling guidance
- Prefer concise sections + bullets for scanability.
- Keep headings natural and reader-facing.
- Keep structure flexible: section count and bullet count should match article complexity.
- Avoid empty phrases and generic praise.

## 4) Bilingual guidance
- `zh` and `en` should carry equivalent meaning.
- Natural wording can differ; key points should not diverge.
- If one language needs slight restructuring for readability, keep factual alignment intact.
