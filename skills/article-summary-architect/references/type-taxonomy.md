# Thinking Lenses (Optional)

This file provides optional thinking lenses for organizing summaries.
These are guidance tools, not required output labels.

## 1) Why this exists
Use a lens only when it helps you compress the article more clearly.
If the article is mixed or ambiguous, pick the dominant signal and continue.
Do not expose schema-like labels unless the user explicitly asks.

## 2) Useful lenses
- `Postmortem`: symptom -> cause -> fix -> prevention
- `Tutorial`: goal -> prerequisites -> steps -> pitfalls
- `Implementation`: objective -> constraints -> design path -> trade-offs
- `Comparison`: options -> dimensions -> differences -> choice advice
- `Research`: question -> evidence -> finding -> confidence/limits
- `Narrative/Opinion`: position -> rationale -> counterpoint -> recommendation
- `Learning notes`: key concepts -> mental model -> practical takeaway

## 3) Lightweight signal hints
You can quickly infer a lens from:
1. Title/headings vocabulary.
2. Artifact style (code-heavy, table-heavy, incident timeline, etc.).
3. Dominant paragraph intent (teaching, arguing, comparing, diagnosing).

## 4) Anti-patterns
- Do not force one lens when evidence is mixed.
- Do not pick technical framing only because code snippets exist.
- Do not output type tags that distract readers from content.
