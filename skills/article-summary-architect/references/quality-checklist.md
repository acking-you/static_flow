# Quality Checklist

Run this checklist before finalizing `detailed_summary`.

## 1) Structural Checks

1. Summary starts with a natural定位句 (not machine-style schema label).
2. Summary has 3-5 semantic sections with clear headings.
3. Each section contains concise bullet points (2-4 typical).
4. Chinese and English versions are semantically aligned.

## 2) Evidence Checks

1. Each core claim is traceable to article body evidence.
2. No fabricated metrics, timelines, or benchmark numbers.
3. No claim that contradicts the article.

## 3) Readability Checks

1. Bullets are concise and non-redundant.
2. Reader can infer "what this article gives me" in under 20 seconds.
3. Jargon is controlled; unexplained terms are minimized.
4. Bullet density is appropriate (usually 8-14 per language).
5. Not a flat bullet wall.

## 4) Type-Fit Checks

1. The chosen `Domain.Intent` matches dominant article evidence.
2. Reasoning flow fits the chosen type (without forcing a fixed format).
3. Non-technical posts are not forced into technical language.

## 5) Bilingual Consistency Checks

1. `zh` and `en` have semantically equivalent claims.
2. No major point appears in only one language.
3. Tone and specificity are consistent across both languages.

## 6) Fail Conditions (Must Rewrite)

Rewrite required if any of these occurs:
1. Missing定位句 or missing core conclusion.
2. Generic summary with no article-specific evidence.
3. Internal type choice cannot be justified from text evidence.
4. English/Chinese content diverges materially.
5. Entire summary is a single undivided bullet list.
