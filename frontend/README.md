# Static Flow Frontend

This crate contains the Yew-based client for the Static Flow experience. It renders the blog shell, theme toggles, article detail pages, tag/category listings, and shared layout in WebAssembly so the UI can stay extremely fast while consuming static or API-provided content.

## Development Environment

- **Rust** stable toolchain (1.75+ recommended)
- **wasm32-unknown-unknown** target: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
- **Trunk** CLI for bundling and serving (`cargo install trunk`)
- Optional: a local API on `http://localhost:3000` if you want the proxy in `Trunk.toml` to forward requests during development

## Common Commands

```bash
# Start the development server with automatic rebuilds
trunk serve

# Create an optimized production bundle in dist/
trunk build --release

# Format Rust code
cargo fmt

# Lint with Clippy (fail on warnings by default)
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

```

## Workflow & Notes

1. Run `trunk serve` in watch mode for local development. The proxy defined in `Trunk.toml` can forward API calls to a backend at `localhost:3000` so the UI behaves closer to production.
2. Keep `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` clean before pushing to ensure CI parity.
3. Static assets go in `static/` and will be copied directly into the final `dist/` bundle.

## Current Progress & TODO

**Done**
- Responsive shell with sticky/fixed header, mobile navigation, and dark-mode toggle
- Article listing cards, detail page typography, and tag/category listing views
- Basic routing + placeholder data models for articles/categories/tags

**Next up**
- Hook real data sources into `models.rs`/`gloo-net` requests (currently stubbed)
- Flesh out loading & skeleton states for article pages once the API is wired
- Add integration/visual regression tests or snapshots once the routes stabilize
- Polish search interactions (keyboard shortcuts, history) and wire to backend

## UI Copy & Localization

- All user-facing frontend copy is centralized in `src/i18n/`.
- Current active locale is `i18n::current` (currently aliased to `zh_cn`).
- To add another language later:
  1. Add a new locale file (for example `en_us.rs`) under `src/i18n/`.
  2. Keep key/module structure aligned with `zh_cn.rs`.
  3. Switch `pub use zh_cn as current;` in `src/i18n/mod.rs` to the target locale.
- Dynamic copy templates use `fill_one` / `fill_two` helpers in `src/i18n/mod.rs`.
